<strong>Final Con LTPH:</strong> 
Final Con LTPH shows “Out of Bounds” when the current value is more than 7 LTPH different when compared to the expected rate calculated using the pump speed and density data from the last 540 days.
<br/>	
Items to investigate:
<ul>
    <li>Is the pump wearing out?  Higher pump speed needed for same LPTH.</li>
    <li>Final Con sample density check</li>
    <li>Dye test on flow meter</li>
</ul>
